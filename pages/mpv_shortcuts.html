	<p><a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> is a free (as in freedom) media player.</p>
	
	<p>The graphical interface is barebone, and I like it that way. You use the keyboard to interact with the media: there's no need to search through menus with your mouse, just press the correct button on your keyboard. My problem is that I can never remember the shortcuts.</p>
	
	<p>You can always consult the manual, either <a href="https://mpv.io/manual/master/">online</a> or locally with <code>man mpv</code>.</p>
	
	<p>I prefer to have a limited list of the ones I actually use:</p>
	
	<pre><code>p / SPACE  - Pause/Unpause
LEFT/RIGHT - Seek backward/forward 5 sec
UP/DOWN    - Seek forward/backward 1 min
ENTER      - Go forward in the playlist
q          - Stop playing and quit

[ and ]    - Decrease/increase current playback speed by 10%
BACKSPACE  - Reset playback speed to normal

#          - Cycle through the available audio tracks
Ctrl +/-   - Adjust audio delay by +/- 0.1 seconds
m          - Mute sound

v          - Toggle subtitle visibility
j and J    - Cycle through the available subtitles
x and z    - Adjust subtitle delay by +/- 0.1 seconds
r and t    - Move subtitles up/down

s          - Take a screenshot
f          - Toggle fullscreen

1 and 2    - Adjust contrast.
3 and 4    - Adjust brightness.
5 and 6    - Adjust gamma.
7 and 8    - Adjust saturation</code></pre>
	
	<p>Put that somewhere handy, like the home directory.</p>
