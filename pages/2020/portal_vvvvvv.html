	<h2>The original game</h2>

	<p>VVVVVV is a 2D platformer released in 2010 by Terry Cavanagh. It's a fun game with simple but engaging mechanics and the soundtrack is great.</p>
	
	<p>The source code of the game was released in January 2020 
	(<a href="https://distractionware.com/blog/2020/01/vvvvvv-is-now-open-source/">Announcement</a>, 
	<a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/vvvvvv">GitHub repo</a>).
	It's not free software, but the license allows anyone to compile the game and run it. 
	The assets are proprietary though, but they can be downloaded <a href="https://thelettervsixtim.es/makeandplay/">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>It's a fun game. You just need to compile it yourself, which should be easy for you.</p>
	
	<p><u>Some quick instructions for a debian-like OS:</u></p>
	
	<pre><code>sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
git clone https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/vvvvvv
cd VVVVVV/desktop_version
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
wget https://thelettervsixtim.es/makeandplay/data.zip
./VVVVVV</code></pre>
	
	<p>(More instructions in the GitHub repository)</p>
	
	<h2>VVVVVV portal mod</h2>
	
	<p>Since the code was public, I decided to look inside, and eventually to make a small mod
	 (<a href="https://github.com/AB036/portal_VVVVVV">link</a>).</p>
	
	<p>My mod adds portal mechanics using the mouse.
	 Left and right click create blue and orange portals, and the player can teleport between the two.</p>

	<p>Inverting gravity is still possible. When you combine it with the portals,
	 it made the game too easy. To keep the game interesting, there are small modifications
	 on a lot of levels.</p>
	 
	 <img class="center-fit" alt="vvvvvv_screenshot" src="vvvvvv_screenshot.png">
	 
	 <p>Taking inspiration from hardcoded levels in the original source, I hardcoded the portals sprites. 
	 This was actually useful because I didn't have to modify the building process to include a new asset.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Closing words</h2>
	 
	 <p>It was a fun project that was only possible because VVVVVV exists and its code was released, so thanks Terry.</p>
	 
	 <p>Should you wish to play <b>Portal VVVVVV</b>, the building process is the same as the original game. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
	 
	 <p>By the way, "Piercing the Sky" is the best track of the OST. It's not included in the original levels for some reason.</p>
