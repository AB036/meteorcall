	<h1>Advent of code 2020</h1>
    
    <h2>What is it</h2>
    
    <p>Each year since 2015, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is a series of 25 puzzles in December.</p>
    
    <p>The goal of a puzzle is to compute the correct output by following the instruction and using a given text input. There are no restrictions on the language or techniques you can use.</p>

    <p>The event can be seen as competetive programming: the puzzles are released at the same time worldwide and a leaderboard system tracks the fastest answers. The first to get the correct answer receives 100 points, the second gets 99 points and the 100th gets 1 point (only the first 100 to correctly answer the problem get points.).</p>

    <p>I participated in 2017, 2018 and 2019 using Python. It was a great experience and I got to learn a lot about algorithms and Python. In 2018 and 2019, I even got in the global leaderboard (look me up, I'm user #230381).</p>
    
    <p>Python is an excellent language for solving these puzzles quickly because it is very fast to write Python scripts and you typically do not need very high execution speed in AoC.</p>
    
    <p>Advent of Code is a great tool to learn more about languages and algorithms because it provides exercises which are definitely necessary to get better (like everything in life, you can't get better at it without actual practice). Additionally, the Christmas theme and seeing everyone doing these problems are good sources of motivation.</p>
    
    

    <h2>Using Zig to solve 2020</h2>

    <p>This year, I didn't want to wake up at 6 AM every day in December to solve Advent of Code. Using Python would not have been interesting because I already know the language well and I wasn't trying to get in the leaderboard.</p>
    
    <p>I decided to use Zig to learn the language. Zig is supposed to be "like C but better while staying simple".</p>
    
    <p>The language is still immature (latest version is 0.7.1) but it already works quite well. There is one <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">documentation page</a> but it only covers the basis. To understand how to use the stdlib, the best method is to look directly at its <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std">source code</a>. Each file has some unit tests that also serve as examples.</p>
    
    <p>After using Zig to solve these simple problems, I find that I like the language a lot. I hope its developement will continue and that it will get more traction in the future.</p>
