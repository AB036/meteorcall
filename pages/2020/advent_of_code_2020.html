	<h1>Advent of code 2020</h1>
    
    <h2>What is it</h2>
    
    <p>Each year since 2015, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is a series of 25 puzzles in December.</p>
    
    <p>The puzzles are somewhat interesting if you like programming. You get a tour of classic programming problems and solving methods. It's always nice to learn and practice.</p>

    <p>Python is a nice language to use because it's easy and fast to write scripts with it. I made it in the top 100 twice thanks to it (there's a global leaderboard on the website).</p>

    <p>I used Zig to solve the 2020 edition. Zig is supposed to be "like C but better while staying simple".</p>
    
    <p>The language is still immature (latest version is 0.7.1) but it already works quite well. There is one <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">documentation page</a> but it only covers the basis. To understand how to use the stdlib, the best method is to look directly at its <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std">source code</a>. Each file has some unit tests that also serve as examples.</p>
